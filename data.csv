"In 2018, D'Ernest Johnson wasn't signed by any NFL team after failing to be drafted.
So, he took up a job on a fishing boat in Key West, Florida, reeling in mahi mahi to make ends meet.
Now, three years later and having put in the work, Johnson is a match-winning NFL running back.
With the Cleveland Browns missing their two starting running backs in Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt, 
Johnson took advantage, rushing for a career-high 146 yards and a touchdown in the Browns' 17-14 victory 
over the Denver Broncos on Thursday night.
In his first career start, Johnson looked composed and explosive as he helped a 
depleted Browns team -- also missing starting quarterback Baker Mayfield -- to a victory which halted a 
two-game losing streak.
His performance on Thursday earned praise from one of the Browns' most famous fans, 
NBA superstar LeBron James, as the 36-year-old tweeted: ""D' Ernest Johnson on 1 tonight!! Love to see it!""
And when Johnson was told about the tweet, he looked stunned, 
saying: ""LeBron? Man, that's my favorite basketball player; I'm not going to lie to you ... That's 
amazing! LeBron James, appreciate it man. That means a lot. Wow!""
It is the culmination of a long journey for the running back, who also worked as a personal trainer 
before signing for the Alliance of American Football league, where he finished second in the league 
in rushing and scrimmage yards while with the Orlando Apollo in 2019.
Although he was initially signed by the Browns as an undrafted free agent in 2019, he had predominately 
featured as a kick returner on special teams.
He appeared in all 16 games in 2020, whilst also filling in where needed as a running back, posting 
career highs in carries (33) and rushing yards (166).
But it is in week seven this season where Johnson really exploded onto the scene with the Browns 
needing a big performance with their stars on the sideline.
Johnson became the third Browns running back to have 100 or more scrimmage yards in a game this season, 
joining Chubb and Hunt. To put that in context, five NFL teams have yet to have one running back do so 
in a game this season.
""It's unexplainable. I wanted to celebrate but I didn't know what to do. It's been a long journey,"" said 
Johnson as he reflected on how his fortunes have changed since 2018.
The victory means the Browns remained alive in the AFC playoff picture, while it is the Broncos' fourth 
straight defeat.
For Broncos linebacker Von Miller, it was perhaps an even more painful defeat given the talking he 
did beforehand.
In the lead up to Thursday's game, Miller said: ""I'm going to have a great game. I'm going to go out 
there, and going to have to play well and get a couple sacks.
""And if I do that then we will win ... If I can play well and I can get sacks and I can find a way to 
disrupt the game, we'll win. The pressure is on me to play well.
""I don't know who the tackle is that I'm going against, but I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kill 
him. And the other guy too, on the other side. I'm going to play extremely well and make plays for my 
team. I'm going to set us up and win this game for sure.""

However in the disappointing performance, Miller was forced to leave after injuring his ankle.
And the Super Bowl 50 MVP said his ""pride is hurt more than anything.""
""I talked a lot of s**t before this game and I wanted to make it personal. I wanted the animosity. 
I wanted this to be that game, and I wanted to win it,"" Miller said.
""We did some good things in the half and I felt like I was gonna do some great stuff in the second 
half -- but I got hurt.""",Sports
"Tom Brady congratulated Aaron Rodgers for becoming a ""shareholder of the Bears"" after the Green Bay 
Packers quarterback's celebration in which he could be heard saying he ""owned"" the Chicago team.
After scoring a six-yard rushing touchdown in the Packers 24-14 win over their division rivals, 
microphones close to Rodgers heard him goading fans in Soldier Field in Chicago.
""I've owned you all my f**king life!"" Rodgers shouted. ""I own you. I still own you.""
And Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Brady humorously congratulated Rodgers on his new ownership 
role, after he improved his all-time record against the Bears to 22-5.
""I wanted to say congrats to Aaron Rodgers,"" Brady said on his weekly SiriusXM NFL Radio show on 
Wednesday as he prepares to face the Bears this Sunday. ""Obviously, I know he's a great 
quarterback, but I guess he's now a shareholder of the Bears. ""I saw a clip of him really 
enthusiastically telling the crowd how happy he is to own Soldier Field. And that's really great 
stuff. He owns the (Milwaukee Bucks) now. Part owner of Soldier Field. So he's got a great career 
beyond football.""
When asked about the celebration in the press conference after the win, Rodgers said it was not unprovoked.
""Sometimes, you black out on the field, in a good way,"" Rodgers said. ""But I looked up in the stands, 
and in the front row, all I saw was a woman giving me the double bird. So I'm not sure exactly what 
came out of my mouth next.""
And having had some time to consider the celebration, Rodgers said it was definitely a ""spur of the 
moment"" action.
""When I got down to my knee and looked up, all I could see and hear was obscenities,"" Rodgers said on 
the Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. ""I didn't plan on telling the crowd that I own them. I think based on 
the statistical reference of my career, win percentage down there against them, definitely our teams 
have done some good things.
""I know I used 'I' a few times, but I do feel like it's a 'we' thing. Really since (Brett) Favre took 
over, we've flipped that entire series on its head. When Favre-y took over, we were double-digits in the 
hole in the all-time series.
""This series has been going on for 100 years plus, and now we're seven up, so it feels good to be on 
this side of it. That was a special moment looking back. I didn't realize how crazy it would go ... I 
love the response of my teammates backing me up.""",Sports
"Leading Formula One drivers defended the popular Netflix ""Drive to Survive"" fly-on-the-wall series on 
Thursday after Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen said he was snubbing it because he felt 
some of the rivalries were ""faked.""
The docu-series, now filming its fourth season, has been credited as a big factor in fueling the sport's 
growth in the United States.
Dutch 24-year-old Verstappen earlier told the Associated Press that he recognized the importance of the 
series but did not like being a part of it and would not be giving any interviews.
Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, Verstappen's title rival, told reporters at the 
U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, that he had noticed a surge in interest in the country.
""In this last couple of years it's been the steepest rise and more and more people are talking about it, 
more and more people engaging,"" he said.
""The amount of emails and messages I get from people I've known for years in the States and who never 
knew what I was doing and now are hooked and can't wait to come. I think a lot of them are coming 
this weekend.""

Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez, a two-times race winner who featured heavily last season, 
said he respected what the documentary was doing.
""What it has done for Formula One is tremendous. It's really something I appreciate,"" he said.
""The way they sell the sport is a bit of a drama. It is a show but at the end of the day it is good for 
the sport and is good for the fans so I am happy with it.""
McLaren's Lando Norris, voted the second-most popular driver after Verstappen in a fan survey published 
on Thursday, also appreciated the show.
""I'm fine with it,"" he said. ""I think it's a cool thing. Coming to America there are so many people 
who are now into Formula One just because of watching 'Drive to Survive.' I think I come across on it 
alright.
""I think they do a good job. I can't really speak on behalf of Max.""
His Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo agreed: ""Most of us experience the effect it's had on the 
sport. There's certainly been a lot of growth and I honestly see that most in America.
""There's times where you want a little bit of space or privacy but I do think if you let them know 
no cameras in this room they are pretty good with that.""",Sports
"Greece's Maria Sakkari will make her debut at the WTA Finals after the 26-year-old qualified for 
the season-ending championships after reaching the quarterfinals at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow.
Sakkari edged past Russia's Anna Kalinskaya in the second round on Thursday, taking the first set 
6-2 before Kalinskaya retired in the second set which Sakkari was leading 1-0.
Sakkari, who will face Simona Halep in the last eight, continues a breakthrough season where she 
finished runner-up at the WTA 500 event in Ostrava, Czech Republic and reached the semifinals at the 
French and the US Open majors.
""I'm very proud of myself and my team that we actually made it to the Finals for the first time, and 
for the first time in the history of Greece for a female tennis player,"" Sakkari said.
""I was very hard on myself up until this year ... Growing, and also getting older and more mature,

"Gymnast Simone Biles, who disclosed her mental health struggles during the Tokyo Olympics, says 
she's ""still scared to do gymnastics.""
In an emotional interview on NBC's ""Today"" show on Thursday, Biles said she's still struggling 
with the ""twisties"" as she performs on her Gold Over America Tour. The twisties is a mental block 
where competitors can lose track of where they are while in midair.
""I don't twist (on tour). I do double lay half-outs, which is my signature move on the floor. 
That's never affected me. But everything else weighs so heavy, and I watch the girls do it, and 
it's not the same,"" said Biles, arguably the greatest gymnast of all time.
""But the twisting, once I got back, will come back. But I'm still scared to do gymnastics,"" she added.
Biles, 24, who has won seven Olympic medals, including four golds, battled mental health issues 
and the unexpected loss of a family member during the Summer Games.
Last month, Biles testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the FBI's handling of 
sexual abuse claims against former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.
Biles, alongside McKayla Maroney, Maggie Nichols and Aly Raisman -- all of whom were abused by 
him -- focused on how the FBI botched its investigation and the intimidation that came from the 
sport's governing bodies.
""For so many years to go through everything that I've gone through, put on a front, I'm proud of 
myself, and I'm happy that I can be a leader for the survivors and bring courage to everybody 
speaking up, so I'm happy to be a voice for them,"" Biles said on Today.
At the Olympics, Biles withdrew during the team final and then withdrew ahead of the all-around 
final and individual events of vault, uneven bars and floor exercise. She did compete in the balance 
beam final, winning bronze.
""To do something that I've done forever and just not be able to do it because of everything I've gone 
through is really crazy, because I love this sport so much. It's hard, I'm sorry. And I don't think 
people understand the magnitude of what I go through,"" Biles said, her voice breaking up.
Biles said she has many techniques to help with her mental wellness, including using the mental health 
app Cerebral. She is now the chief impact officer with the company.
""Getting the mental health therapy that I need has been really relieving for me, especially being on 
the road and on tour. I'm happy to have such a great app to help out with that,"" she said.
Biles said she also likes taking walks outside and indulges in a little retail therapy.",Sports
"The NBA is facing another incident involving China after Enes Kanter, center for the Boston 
Celtics, criticized the country's treatment of Tibet.
The broadcast of the Celtics' season-opening game against the New York Knicks was pulled by 
Chinese video-streaming site Tencent, while fans took to Chinese social media to denounce Kanter and 
the Celtics.
The website for Tencent Sports also indicated that upcoming Celtics games would not be 
livestreamed, rather just an interactive graphic shown instead.
On Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, a Celtics fan page with approximately 615,000 followers 
posted that it would not be posting updates from the team because of a player's social media oversights.
""From now on, our page will no longer report any information about the Boston Celtics, and our 
Weibo will stop updating!"" read the post from Celtics Weibo Express. ""For any behavior that undermines 
harmony of the nations and the dignity of the motherland, we resolutely resist!""
On Wednesday, Kanter posted a video on social media directed at President Xi Jinping and the Chinese 
government with the caption ""Tibet belongs to the Tibetan people"" calling Xi a ""brutal dictator"" 
while wearing a t-shirt featuring the 14th Dalai Lama, the Buddhist spiritual leader of the Tibetan 
people. The Dalai Lama has been living in exile in India since a failed uprising against Chinese rule 
in 1959 and regularly travels the world to spread his message of tolerance and peace.
CNN has reached out to the NBA and Tencent for comment.
""My message to the Chinese government is free Tibet,"" Kanter said. ""Tibet belongs to Tibetans, I am 
here to add my voice and speak out against what is happening in Tibet under the Chinese government's 
brutal rule.""
""Under the Chinese government's brutal rule, Tibetan people's basic rights and freedoms are 
non-existent.""
Kanter followed it up with another post which said: ""More than 150 Tibetan people have burned 
themselves alive!! -- hoping that such an act would raise more awareness about Tibet. I stand with 
my Tibetan brothers and sisters, and I support their calls for Freedom.""
Later in the day, when Kanter's Boston Celtics took to the court in their season-opening game 
against the New York Knicks, he was wearing shoes with the message ""Free Tibet"" on the side.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a news briefing on Thursday that Kanter 
was ""trying to get attention"" and that his remarks ""were not worth refuting.""
""We will never accept those attacks to discredit Tibet's development and progress,"" he said.
Kanter's comments come two years after Daryl Morey, the then-general manager of the Houston 
Rockets, sparked controversy between the NBA and China with a tweet in support of pro-democracy 
protestors in Hong Kong. Morey stepped down a year later. Several Chinese businesses cut ties with 
the Rockets as a result and the NBA came under severe pressure from Chinese authorities.
Tibet is an internationally recognized autonomous region within the People's Republic of 
China, though many Tibetans dispute the legitimacy of China's rule.
Kanter, who was raised in Turkey, has been vocal before in defense of various political 
causes, including criticisms of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He faced death threats and the 
criminal trial of his father back home as a result.",Sports
"An Italian DJ claims he suffered a number of injuries following an alleged altercation with MMA 
fighter Conor McGregor.
Francesco Facchinetti said McGregor launched an unprovoked attack at the St. Regis Hotel in Rome on 
Saturday, leaving him with injuries to his face and neck.
On Tuesday Facchinetti told CNN he decided to press charges against McGregor ""because the world 
needs to know the fact that he is dangerous.""
Facchinetti posted an image of the crime report about the incident on his Instagram feed.
The Carabinieri police in Mariano Comasco, Como province, confirmed to CNN that Facchinetti and his 
lawyer formally pressed charges Tuesday.
CNN has contacted McGregor's representatives for comment.
Facchinetti says he was part of a group McGregor invited to the hotel for a party, but he says McGregor 
allegedly lashed out when he and his group said they wanted to leave, claiming McGregor hit him on 
the mouth and nose.
Facchinetti says he suffered an alleged concussion and decided to press charges after discussing 
the incident with his wife and friends.
""He is dangerous, he needs to be stopped,"" Facchinetti told CNN.
Facchinetti said he hopes that the luxury hotel will have CCTV footage of the incident.

the hotel's first priority.
""We continue to offer the police our full support in their investigation, and have shared all available 
CCTV with them,"" said the spokesperson in a statement sent to CNN on Wednesday.

"It's not often an NBA star can quietly make his way through a crowd unnoticed. But with celebrities 
like William H. Macy, Martha Stewart, and Guy Fieri roaming the grounds of the Food & Wine Classic in 
Aspen, Colorado last month, Portland Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum figured he had a decent chance to 
quietly taste wines, meet vineyard owners and avoid attention.
""It was a combination of business and pleasure,"" McCollum says. ""I'm only 6'3"", not that tall or 
muscular, so I could blend in. But when you've played a certain team from Colorado a few times in the 
playoffs, some people will notice you.""
Most in the wine industry shouldn't be surprised to run into an elite NBA player at a wine tasting in a 
tiny mountain town. McCollum is one of many players in the league who are well-documented enthusiasts 
of Pinots, chardonnay and cabernets.
""There's a huge emphasis on chemistry building in the NBA,"" the nine-year veteran explains to CNN 
Sport. ""And there's a lot of dinners and situations where you're breaking bread with teammates, family 
and staff -- and wine is associated with that.
""I go out to dinner with certain teammates, Dame [Lillard] and Melo [Carmelo Anthony] for example, and 
I know Melo is going to bring a white burgundy. I'm going to bring a super Tuscan or something from 
Oregon. JJ Reddick may give me a chardonnay I've never tasted. Josh Hart, Seth Curry, 
KD [Kevin Durant], you have all these friends in the wine space.""
Some former players like Channing Frye and Dwyane Wade, who attended the Classic in 2019, 
now have their own wine labels. But McCollum, who debuted his own McCollum 91 Pinot Noir label 
last year, has taken it one step further.
The day the Wine & Food Classic opened for tasting, CJ and his wife Elise McCollum closed on the 
purchase of a 318-acre vineyard-to-be in Oregon's Willamette Valley. The couple's new property -- which 
includes a reservoir, multiple micro-climates and a nursery operation -- borders the vineyard where 
McCollum's Pinot noir is currently produced.
""As far as players, I think I'm the only one,"" McCollum says when asked if any others in the league own 
their own vineyard. ""My love for wine has continued to grow, to being interested in all phases of 
wine -- from the process of making it to the business side. And we now have a blank canvas. We can 
build it out the way we want.""
The McCollums' plan is to start prepping the land on their vineyard in late December 2021, before 
planting roughly 8,800 Pinot grape vines in spring 2022.
According to the 2020 Oregon Vineyard and Winery Census report, 70% of the Willamette Valley's vineyard 
acreage is dedicated to growing Pinot noir grapes.
""It takes about three years to turn grapes around from vine to bottle ... especially when it's from 
unplanted soil,"" explains McCollum. ""I would say sometime between 2025 and 2027, we'll be able to say 
that we grew our own wines from our own land. And that's really cool to say out loud.""
Regardless of when the first bottles from the yet-to-be-named vineyard land in consumers' wine 
vaults, McCollum believes the barometer for his and his wife's winemaking success will come years earlier.
""I'm in a position now as a Black male who has influence. My role is to continue to figure out ways to 
make this approachable, to make it diverse and create equity and inclusion. We need to figure out 
ways to expand and bring in new backgrounds from new places.""
The McCollums' initial goal is to hire a diverse and talented staff to help them get the operation 
growing while Elise focuses on her dentistry practice, CJ on his NBA career, and both on their first 
child due in a couple of months.
""In basketball, you need coaches, you need staff, you need players. And the same goes for the vineyard,"" 
says McCollum. ""You need a farm manager, you need operations, you need all these people who specialize 
and can be stars in their roles. And that's what we're doing, we're building a dream team.
""But we also have talked about ways to provide opportunities and channels from a mentorship and 
internship standpoint to learn about all aspects of the wine business, not just physically making the 
grapes, but learning all the behind the scenes of the business.
""There's a lot of people out here in the Willamette Valley aligned with trying to make this space more 
diverse. They understand the bottom line is that, not only will you bring more people into the wine 
space, but you'll get a better product from it.""
Morgen McLaughlin, executive director of the Willamette Valley Wineries Association, agrees. ""I can only 
imagine there's going to be a lot of people who want to be part of that team,"" she tells CNN Sport.
She says the McCollums' investment into the valley, along with CJ's work with former teammate Channing 
Frye on the One Barrel Challenge, a fundraising effort to promote accessibility and inclusivity in the 
Oregon wine industry, will have an overwhelmingly positive effect.
""Black people having ownership roles is really important. As a White person, it's hard for me to say 
we're trying to diversify the wine industry and get more people drinking wine. But it's much different 
when it's coming from someone of that caliber and that visibility.""
Through it all, McCollum hopes his legacy will be more than just as a great basketball player that 
learned how to make a great Pinot noir.
""It's more about how we treat people, empower people, put people in a position to succeed. I think 
all those things are more important than me just shooting a basketball.""",Sports
"With 100 race wins and seven world championships to his name so far, Lewis Hamilton can arguably claim 
to be the greatest Formula One driver in history.
Not that the 36-year-old Briton, who has the most race wins or podium places in F1 history, is thinking 
like that.
""I don't think a lot about the whole 'greatest of all time' because I think it's very hard to compare 
people,"" Hamilton told CNN Sport's Coy Wire.
""Just in that one moment, it's about being the greatest you can be and living to your full potential.
""So that's something that I just search for and [to stay] as focused and driven as I could possibly be.
""I think the surprising thing is that I've been racing this long and I still have that same feeling 
when I fail or when I don't succeed, and I turn that into a positive and use it as fuel.
""I thought that that would wear off as I got older, but it's not.""
It's an approach that has seen Hamilton rise to the very top of his sport, passing some of his idols 
along the way.
Hamilton is now fighting for an eighth world title this season, a championship which would pull him 
clear of a record he currently shares with racing legend Michael Schumacher.
That's quite the accolade for the boy who was expelled from school all those years ago and whose 
father, Anthony, juggled three jobs, re-mortgaged the family home and dipped into his life savings 
to keep his son in karting.
""My dream was always to get to Formula One, to do something like Ayrton Senna -- he had three world 
titles,"" the Mercedes driver and IWC Ambassador added.
""And then to see myself match him at one point, and then go beyond that.
""To think that I'm here today, where most people don't even get one championship and to have seven is 
very, very crazy still.
""But every year when I come back, it's like a reset. Like, I'm not a champion. I have no titles. 
I'm going for the first.
""That's kind of my mentality. But an eighth? I don't know. I never really say.""
Perhaps the biggest challenge standing in the way of an eighth world title is long-time rival Max 
Verstappen.
The Dutch superstar currently leads the standings with seven race wins this year but, while 
acknowledging Verstappen is in dangerous form, Hamilton says his focus remains on his own performance 
and team.
""I think for us it's just making sure we continue to enjoy the journey, to not apply too much pressure 
to ourselves because we've been here many, many times before,"" he said.
""But not let that desire and that yearning for success overpower everything and put added pressure 
on us that we don't really need.
""But it's all about preparation, making sure we're the best prepared we can be.""
In addition to his own desire, Hamilton has found inspiration from all corners of society and from all 
manner of sports.
Speaking to CNN from Austin ahead of the US Grand Prix this weekend, the driver acknowledged how much 
he can learn from the likes of NFL veteran Tom Brady.
Like Hamilton, Brady is considered one of the best in the history of his sport and the similarities 
don't stop there.
While the Brit has won seven world championships, the 44-year-old quarterback can boast seven Super Bowl 
titles and is still competing at the highest level today.
""I think, naturally, when you're an athlete, you definitely see people that you can relate to,"" Hamilton 
explained.
""I've had the privilege of watching Tom's success and we were actually neighbors for a second literally.
""I think it's really kind of the mentality of an athlete: the drive, the training regime, the attention 
to detail and the kind of the constant push for perfection.
""But also the teamwork element of being the team leader, being a part of a large group of people who 
are all driven towards a common goal.
""He's such an incredible leader, so I take more inspiration from that.""
Brady has openly talked about his desire to keep playing in the NFL and has said, perhaps somewhat 
tongue in cheek, that he could play until he's 50.
Such a long career is not something Hamilton is seriously entertaining but the driver is far from 
hanging up his gloves.
He still possesses that competitive edge -- a trait honed by racing his brother on computer games from 
an early age -- and still has that appetite for adrenaline.
""I don't think I'll be racing until I'm 50. But who knows? I'm for sure going to be doing things 
like it,"" he said, smiling.
""Whether it's skydiving, whether it's surfing, whether it's just going to a local track, go-karting 
with friends or whatever it is.
""I think I'm never going to give it up necessarily but perhaps, professionally, I'll have to.""
While growing into the elite sportsman he is today, Hamilton has continued to use his global 
platform to fight for more than just success on the track.
He has been an outspoken voice on issues such as climate change and equality and has put pressure 
on his sport, and wider society, to become more tolerant and face issues around lack of diversity.
It's a mission perhaps born out of his own life experiences -- Hamilton says the education system in 
the UK ""failed"" him growing up after he was kicked out of school for something he says he didn't do.
Black Caribbean students were around 1.7 times more likely to be permanently excluded from UK schools 
compared with White British students, according to the Hamilton Commission -- a report led by the 
driver which looked to address the under representation of Black people in UK motorsport and the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) sector.
""I was one of those,"" Hamilton said.
But the seven-time champion has channeled his setbacks into a cause for good, setting up Mission 44 -- a 
foundation that looks to support, promote and empower young people from underrepresented groups in the UK.
""Only 1% of the 40,000 people in the industry in the UK alone are from Black backgrounds,"" Hamilton 
said, admitting there was still a huge amount of work to be done.
""We've got to change the pipeline. We've got to get more eyes, get more encouragement for these young 
kids to get into STEM subjects so they realize that there are so many great avenues that engineering 
can lead to.""",Sports
"President Joe Biden faces a number of economic concerns, from supply chain disruptions to inflation. 
But the White House will soon need to tackle another major financial issue: whether or not to nominate 
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for a second term.
Powell's tenure as Fed chair is set to end in February, and a growing number of prominent Democrats in 
Washington are calling on Biden to choose someone else to head the Fed.
Until a few months ago, it seemed like a slam dunk that Biden would follow the lead of his former boss, 
Barack Obama, and ignore partisan politics.
After all, Obama stuck with Ben Bernanke for a second term during the immediate aftermath of the Great 
Recession in 2009 -- even though Bernanke was first selected by former President George W. Bush.
By nominating Powell to remain as the boss of the central bank, Biden would be signaling that he wants 
continuity as the economy rebounds from the pandemic and the Fed begins to unwind its stimulus measures. 
Powell was chosen by former President Donald Trump for the job in 2017.
The Fed is expected to soon start the process of cutting back on its bond purchases that helped keep 
long-term rates low, a process known as tapering. Short-term rate hikes are also expected as soon as 
the end of 2022.
""Biden fits more into the camp of being an older-school politician. It's dissimilar to the last 
administration,"" said Scott Pike, senior portfolio manager at Income Research + Management.
""I think he's leaning more towards reappointing Powell and there is support for that from the other 
side even if there is pushback from some in his own party. Powell is still the frontrunner,"" Pike added.
But the the situation has changed in the past few months, which raises the possibility that Biden could 
instead go the Trump route and dump Powell after one term -- just as Trump chose Powell instead of 
nominating Janet Yellen (who is now Treasury Secretary) for a second stint as Fed chair.
Several key leaders of the progressive movement in DC, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have expressed concerns about Powell's push for deregulation of big financial 
firms.
These Democrats have also argued that the Fed, under Powell's watch, has also not done enough to 
promote racial and gender equality or tackle risks stemming from climate change.
A scandal about personal stock trading by former regional Fed presidents Robert Kaplan and Eric 
Rosengren, who led the Dallas and Boston Fed, respectively, before recently resigning, may also dampen 
Powell's chances at getting nominated again.
As such, Biden may not want to test his chances by sticking with Powell if it seems like the Senate, 
which has to confirm any Fed chair nomination, may balk at the pick. Biden might need to nominate a 
woman or Black person instead.
According to Predictit, an online exchange that gives odds on political events, traders now think there 
is a 72% chance that Powell will be confirmed by the Senate next year. That's still high, but it's down 
from a 90% probability as recently as September 12.
Lael Brainard, a current member of the Fed's Board of Governors, is listed as having a 23% chance. 
Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor who served as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in the Obama 
administration, is also being tracked by Predictit but is considered a long shot.
Atlanta Fed chief Rapahel Bostic, who recently banned his staff from using the word ""transitory"" to 
describe inflation even though it's Powell's preferred phrase, and former Fed member Roger Ferguson are 
each given a small chance of being the next Fed chair as well. Both are Black.
The Fed was not immediately available for comment regarding questions about what's next for Powell. But 
during a press conference last month, Powell shot down speculation about his future.
""I'm focused on doing my job every day for the American people, and I don't have any comment on that,"" 
he said.
The White House was also not available for comment.
However, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this 
month that the president ""does have confidence in Powell at this time.""
Still, even if Powell winds up being one and done as Fed chair, that may not matter too much to the 
market.
While investors might prefer to see continuity at the central bank, Income Research + Management's Pike 
said that none of the other rumored Fed chief candidates would likely look to do things all that 
differently than Powell. The tapering will continue and eventual rate hikes will follow.
""Whoever gets in as Fed chair should likely have a business as usual approach,"" Pike said.",Business
"Prices on consumer goods are rising in the United States and tangled supply chains are making it harder 
for shoppers to always get exactly what they want. But these factors are not yet slowing down US shoppers.
Consumers are still dishing out on sporting goods, clothing, furniture, and groceries and spending at 
bars and restaurants, data from the Commerce Department showed Friday.
Retail sales in September grew 0.7% from the month earlier, beating economists' forecast for a 0.2% 
decline. Retail sales in August were also revised upward to a 0.9% monthly increase, up from a previous 
estimate of 0.7%.
The data are promising signs about consumers heading into the winter and pivotal holiday shopping 
stretch for retailers, despite higher prices, shortages and Covid-19 cases.
""Consumer spending has been remarkably resilient throughout [the pandemic], especially on goods,"" 
Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, said in an email to clients Friday. 
""Many Americans have already started their holiday shopping and retailers should have a strong holiday 
season.""
In September, sales at sporting goods, hobby and musical instrument stores jumped 3.7% from the month 
prior. Sales at clothing stores and furniture stores increased 1.1% and 0.2% respectively. Online 
sales rose 0.6%.
Auto sales rose 0.5% in September, even as a shortage of computer chips and shutdowns at auto factories 
choked off some vehicle supply. US automakers have reported a drop in new car sales.
Although the data topped forecasts, some economists still caution that supply chain disruptions and 
inflation may hold back some shoppers in the coming months.
""With goods shortages likely to persist, and the resulting surge in prices eating into real incomes, we 
expect consumption growth to remain subdued,"" Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, 
said in a note to clients Friday.",Business
"The Federal Reserve announced new trading rules on Thursday following a controversy over trades made by 
senior officials.
The Fed said the new rules will ban policymakers and senior staff from buying individual stocks and 
bonds and will restrict active trading. The central bank pledged to also increase the frequency of 
reporting and public disclosures.
The new policy means senior Fed officials will be limited to buying vanilla investment vehicles such as 
mutual funds.
""These tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior 
officials maintain a single-minded focus on the public mission of the Federal Reserve,"" Fed Chairman 
Jerome Powell said in a statement.
In an effort to ""guard against even the appearance of any conflict of interest in the timing of 
investment decisions,"" the Fed said policymakers and senior staff ""generally"" will be required to 
provide 45 days' advance notice for purchases and sales of securities and get prior approval for 
purchases and sales of securities. They will also be required to hold investments for at least one year.
""No purchases or sales will be allowed during periods of heightened financial market stress,"" the Fed said.
The Fed said the restrictions will apply to officials at regional Fed banks as well as the Fed's 
Board of Governors. The policy will prohibit these officials from holding investments in individual bonds, 
entering derivatives or holding investments in agency securities.
The policy comes as the Fed remains engulfed in a trading scandal. Last month, the heads of the Boston and 
Dallas Federal Reserve banks announced early retirements amid criticism of their trades. Boston Fed 
President Eric Rosengren cited health concerns.
The scandal threatens to block Powell's shot at another four-year term running the Fed. Powell's term 
expires in February and the White House has not said whether he will be renominated.
The announcement also comes just after Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the Fed to reveal a March 
2020 ethics memo that could shed light on the Fed's ethics scandal.
Warren tweeted Thursday that it should be illegal for Fed officials to trade individual stocks, and 
that the officials ""must avoid actual and perceived financial conflicts, period.""
""There can be no reform without accountability,"" she tweeted. ""That means disclosure of all trades to 
this point by Fed officials. All relevant Fed ethics guidance should be released publicly. And 
independent IG and SEC investigations must be completed promptly and without Fed interference.""
As part of the rule changes, regional bank presidents at the Fed will be required to publicly disclose 
financial transactions within 30 days. That would bring them in line with board members and senior staff.
The Fed said the restrictions will be incorporated ""over the coming months.""
""The changes announced today by the Federal Reserve are long overdue and a good start, but don't go far 
enough,"" Dennis Kelleher, CEO of financial reform nonprofit Better Markets, said in a statement.
Kelleher, who served on President Joe Biden's agency review team during the transition, said the new 
rules should apply to anyone at the Fed who has possession of potentially market-moving information. 
And he called for senior Fed leaders, including the chair, to be required to put all of their 
investments into a qualified blind trust and be entirely banned from trading. Kelleher also said the 
Fed must still disclose all information and documents related to officials who traded during the pandemic.
""The new policies cannot be used to whitewash the prior bad judgment, failures of leadership and 
violation of the Fed's own policies if not the law,"" Kelleher said.",Business
"Inflation could surge above 5% early next year in the United Kingdom, according to the Bank of 
England's top economist, as product and labor shortages continue to hamper the country's economic 
recovery.
""I would not be shocked â€” let's put it that way â€” if we see an inflation print close to or above 
5% [in the months ahead],"" Huw Pill told the Financial Times. ""And that's a very uncomfortable place for 
a central bank with an inflation target of 2% to be.""
Pill declined to reveal how he would vote at the Bank of England's next meeting on November 4, but he 
said that the question of whether policymakers should hike interest rates from 0.1% is ""live."" Central 
banks use interest rates to keep inflation low and stable.
Inflation has been running near 3% in the United Kingdom as the country's economy bounces back from a 
steep contraction in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But there are signs the recovery is 
faltering, even as inflation remains stubbornly high.
The latest worrying signal came Friday, when the Office for National Statistics said that retail sales 
volumes fell for a fifth consecutive month in September. That's the longest streak of consecutive 
declines since records began in 1996. Non-retail spending was also weak.
Economists worry that the United Kingdom may be entering a period of ""stagflation"" characterized by 
weak economic growth and rising prices.
""The whiff of stagflation is greater in the UK than in most other economies and we now think temporary 
shortages will restrain GDP for longer and boost inflation by more than we previously thought,"" Capital 
Economics analysts wrote this week.
""This won't be anywhere near as severe or as persistent as in the 1970s,"" the analysts said.
""But for the next six months, the worsening product and labor shortages will put the brakes on the 
economic recovery at the same time as higher energy prices drive up CPI inflation from 3.2% in August 
to a peak of around 5.0% in April next year,"" they added.
The United Kingdom is facing severe labor shortages, including a shortfall of 100,000 truck drivers, and 
workers are demanding higher wages, contributing to inflation. Energy prices have risen sharply across 
Europe, and some businesses are passing along higher costs to consumers.
British consumer goods giant Unilever (UL) â€” which sells products around the world â€” said Thursday that 
it hiked prices by 4.1% in the quarter to September.
Governor Andrew Bailey said last weekend that the Bank of England would ""have to act"" in response to 
surging prices. He said he continues to ""believe that higher inflation will be temporary,"" but conceded 
it could last longer than previously thought as a result of energy price hikes.",Business
"The question of who will regulate cutting-edge driving technologies appears to be answered.
For years, the US government hasn't regulated driver-assist systems like Tesla's Autopilot and GM's 
SuperCruise. Automakers can do as they please because there are no standards for these systems.
But President Joe Biden's administration appears to want to change that, with the appointment of Missy 
Cummings, a Duke University engineering professor who studies autonomous systems and has been critical 
of Tesla and the federal government's handling of driver-assist systems like Autopilot. Cummings will 
be a senior advisor for safety at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Government's laissez faire approach to these increasingly common technologies has long led to calls for 
better safeguards and action in the wake of headline-grabbing deaths. Cummings's appointment is the 
latest indication of the Biden administration's desire to step in.
The government said in June that all automakers must report crashes involving driver-assist systems. 
It launched an investigation this August into Teslas using Autopilot that rear-ended emergency vehicles. 
NHTSA has called for proposing a rule for automatic emergency braking, a driver-assist feature.
Cummings's new role triggered a backlash from diehard Tesla fans. A petition circulated by fans called 
for reviewing her appointment and received more than 21,000 signatures as of Friday morning. The attacks 
on Cummings have at times been vitriolic, personal and hyperbolic. Cummings has been described as ""the 
hired gun for the Luddites of mediocrity"" and as someone who wants to destroy Tesla. The automaker's 
passionate fan base has been criticized in the past as being cultish and intolerant of criticism.
The petition from Tesla's fanbase includes a critique of a 2019 tweet from Cummings that said that NHTSA 
should require Tesla to turn off Autopilot. Cummings's Twitter account shifted to private in the wake of 
the backlash and then was deleted.
Tesla's fanbase also criticized Cummings for her ties to the Swedish driver-assist company Veoneer. 
Cummings sits on the company's board of directors.
NHTSA did not make Cummings available for an interview, but spokesperson Lucia Sanchez told CNN 
Business that any possible conflict of interest would be resolved before Cummings starts her work at NHTSA.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has joined in the criticism, calling Cummings's track record ""extremely biased"" 
against Tesla. Cummings responded and said she was ""happy to sit down and talk with you anytime."" Musk 
did not detail what he considered biased, and did not respond to a request for comment. 
(Tesla generally does not engage with the professional news media.) U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete 
Buttigieg reportedly said Wednesday that Musk should call him if he has any concerns.
In the 1990s, Cummings became one of the first women to be a pilot in the Navy. She's said in interviews 
that she later entered academia because she saw the coming tide of autonomous technologies.
Cummings has been called before to testify on Capitol Hill on autonomous driving. She's studied how 
artificial intelligence will impact the future of warfare, and the challenges of boredom while people 
use autonomous systems.
Outside of autonomous driving, Cummings appears to have a favorable view of Tesla. Cummings has said 
that she has a Tesla jacket she wears proudly, that she loves Tesla and can't stand car dealerships. 
(Tesla, unlike virtually all other automakers in the United States, doesn't have a traditional, 
franchised dealership network, but owns its own retail locations)
""I want to do everything I can to support Tesla's business model in those aspects,"" Cummings said in an 
interview earlier this year. ""However, I can no longer be quiet, not as if I ever was, about the 
problems with Autopilot and 'full self-driving.""
She's said this year that some drivers have died unnecessarily. Cummings has said that Tesla should only 
let drivers use Autopilot on the roads for which it's been designed. That echoes a recommendation of 
the National Transportation Safety Board, which has investigated multiple deaths of distracted drivers 
using Tesla's Autopilot system.
Cummings's criticisms of driver-assist technologies are not limited to Tesla. She's said that we should 
get rid of the phrase ""hands-free."" General Motors describes its SuperCruise system as ""hands-free""
""Hands free connotes mind-free,"" Cummings said this year. ""This isn't just a Tesla problem. This problem 
is going to be increasingly in our faces as we start to see more quote unquote hands-free driving from 
other cars.""
Cummings has also criticized Tesla for the name it gives its systems. Autonomous vehicle experts and 
even some of Tesla's own employees have been critical of the naming as well. Cummings has said that 
there have been fewer egregious crashes elsewhere in the world, where regulators prohibit Tesla from 
labeling its technology ""Autopilot."" A German court ruled in 2020 that Tesla was not allowed to 
advertise its driver-assist technology as ""Autopilot.""
""If you're being told your car has a full self-driving chip and how many of us read the fine print? 
It's easy to see how people can develop these incorrect mental models about what their car can do,"" 
Cummings said in an interview this year.
Tesla released its ""full self-driving"" software to about 1,000 people this month. The company has said 
it plans to release it more broadly soon. Some drivers have raved about its abilities while others have 
criticized its shortcomings. Drivers have at times had to intervene to prevent crashes or stop the car 
from running red lights and nearly hitting pedestrians, according to videos published on YouTube that 
CNN Business reviewed.
Tesla has published crash data since 2018 that shows that there are fewer crashes per mile with 
Autopilot than without Autopilot, but critics have called this an apples-and-oranges comparison. 
Autopilot mileage is most likely to come on highways, a type of road that already has fewer crashes per 
mile. MIT research has shown that Tesla drivers are more likely to be distracted when using Autopilot.",Business
"The Financial Stability Oversight Council released a report on climate change Thursday, 
outlining the danger that a warming planet will have on the financial future of the United States.
Climate change is an ""emerging threat to the financial stability of the United States,"" Stephen 
Ledbetter, the executive director and director of policy at the FSOC, said during a call with reporters 
Thursday.
The council's report comes just 10 days before the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP26, 
is set to start. The international talks will take place in Glasgow.
""This report makes it clear that financial regulators understand the need for action to ensure that the 
climate crisis doesn't cause the next financial crisis,"" said Ben Cushing, manager of the Sierra Club's 
Fossil-Free campaign, said in a statement.
He emphasized that the FSOC board left out ""key risk-reduction tools,"" which makes the report more vague

""On top of the threats from climate change itself, climate solutions will threaten financial stability 
if regulators don't steer finance in a more productive direction,"" David Arkush, the director of Public 
Citizen's Climate Program, told CNN Business.
""As of now, Wall Street is aggressively financing fossil fuels,"" he added. ""Investments that will become

"If you're thinking of buying a home or refinancing one, a big question will be whether to get a 
30-year mortgage or opt for a shorter term loan.
Most people get a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, which offers lower monthly payments. But there are some 
instances when it might make sense to consider a 15-year or 20-year mortgage. Such loans will require 
you to make higher monthly payments, but they come with lower interest rates, and they let you build up 
equity in your home much faster.
""A 30-year fixed rate mortgage isn't always the best for a consumer. Most people are singularly 
focused on monthly payments. But owning a home is not just putting a roof over your head. It's part 
of your overall financial plan,"" said Brian Blonder, senior vice president of residential lending 
at Capital Bank N.A., in Maryland.
Here are five questions to consider when making your decision.
Say you borrow $300,000 to finance your home. A 30-year mortgage at 3% will cost you $1,265 per month, 
and $155,332 in interest over the life of the loan.
By contrast, a 20-year mortgage at 2.75% will increase your monthly payments by $361. But it will cut 
the total interest you pay on your home by nearly $65,000. A 15-year mortgage at 1.99% will cost you 
$661 more per month, but save you more than $108,000 in interest costs over the life of the loan. 
There are typically two big tax benefits to owning a home, regardless of which type of mortgage you get: 
the ability to deduct the mortgage interest you pay, as well as state and local property taxes.
But that only matters to you if you itemize deductions on your federal return, which just a small 
minority of tax filers do because for most people it is more advantageous to take the standard deduction.
If, however, you do itemize, ask an accountant if the tax savings you'd realize on a shorter-term 
loan, say a 20-year mortgage, might make it affordable for you, and therefore an attractive alternative 
to the 30-year, given your financial goals.
For instance, while you'll pay about $361 more per month on the 20-year loan in the $300,000 example 
above, you might reduce that amount substantially through tax savings if you're in, say, the 25% tax 
bracket, Blonder said. For instance, you'll save $2,062 in taxes on your interest payments alone in the 
first year. Divided by 12, that comes to $172 in tax savings a month. You'll also save $750 a year, or 
$63 a month, if you're paying $3,000 a year in property taxes.
So now that $361 extra in monthly payments is effectively just $126 more, Blonder explained.
You can do similar math on your 30-year mortgage -- the net monthly payment also will be lower due to 
tax savings if you itemize.
Once you compare the two monthly payments after taking tax savings into account, the question then 
becomes is it worth it to you -- and affordable -- to spend a bit extra on a shorter-term mortgage in 
exchange for building equity more quickly and substantially reducing the interest you pay to own your 
home.
""If one of your objectives is to build wealth, then is it worth it to reach a little further and spend 
an extra $100 to $200 a month to substantially accelerate growth in your net worth?"" Blonder said.
If you're really stretching financially to buy a home, a 30-year may be your best bet because it offers 
the lowest monthly payments and you may need every dollar left over just to meet your other essential 
expenses.
But if you expect to easily have some money left over every month with a 30-year loan, then consider 
where you'll get the most bang for your buck with that money, suggested Mari Adam, a certified financial 
planner in Boca Raton, Florida.
Since 1987, the annualized return on home prices is 4.2%, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 
National Home Price Index.
So if you're planning to bank your extra cash in a savings or investment account that yields less than 
that, you might be better off putting that money instead toward a higher monthly payment on a shorter 
term loan or making extra payments on your 30-year loan, Adam said.
But, she cautioned, ""make sure you can make the bigger monthly payments without question."" That is, you 
have enough in emergency savings and other liquid assets to cover you in the event of a job loss or 
other unanticipated hit to your cash flow.
If you've been in your home for several years and want to refinance to lock in a lower rate, don't opt 
for another 30-year loan, Adam said. ""If you have 10 years left, refinance for 10 years. [Otherwise] 
you're paying the highest amount of [total] interest. Just replace what you've got left on the clock 
unless there's an extenuating circumstance.""
By extenuating circumstance, she means an unexpected hit to your finances, such as a job loss or 
divorce, which may put you at risk of losing your house unless you can cut your monthly payments 
substantially.
Are you someone who simply wants to pay off your debts as soon as possible and pay less to the bank? 
If you can afford to take one, then a 15- or 20-year loan may be your best option, Blonder said.
As home buyers age, they may start to think about what they want to leave their children or simply 
like the idea of being debt-free in retirement.
Adam urges you to consider the counterargument to both those desires: You always need to do what's 
best for yourself financially, and that will depend on your needs and your expected cash flow from 
your retirement assets and fixed income, such as Social Security or a pension.
""It's not about your age. It's about what leaves you in the best position to use your money wisely. 
Cash poor is not smart. Having cash in your pocket to have a better life when you're older [is].""
As for your kids, if you can live well and leave them something when you're gone, great. But if 
not, that's okay, she said. ""Your kids can sort through their own lives.""",Business
"Evergrande has made a crucial payment that allows it to stay out of default, at least for now, according 
to Chinese state media.
State-run financial newspaper Securities Times reported Friday that the embattled property conglomerate 
had made an $83.5 million interest payment on a dollar-denominated bond that was due last month.
A 30-day grace period for that payment is set to expire on Saturday, but Reuters reported, citing an 
unidentified source, that Evergrande has wired the funds and bondholders should receive it before that 
deadline.
Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The news provided some relief to investors and analysts who had once again worried this week that the 
company, which continues to teeter on the brink of collapse, would slip into its first formal default.
It also suggests that the company is taking some effort to appease offshore investors. Previously, 
Evergrande had worked to clear some tabs with domestic lenders while staying silent on its debts to 
international investors, a sign that its priority was to pay back Chinese investors first.
The company's stock jumped 4.3% in Hong Kong on Friday, while shares of its property management and 
electric vehicle units also surged about 4% each.
According to Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst of Asia Pacific at Oanda, a failure to make the bond 
payment this weekend could have allowed some of Evergrande's other creditors to demand their money back, 
adding further strain on the company.
But while Evergrande appears to have settled one of its debts, it is not out of the woods.
Last month, the developer appeared to have missed the deadline for a $47.5 million interest payment on 
another offshore bond. A 30-day grace period for that payment is set to expire next week, according to 
Halley.
For now, the real estate giant has bought itself some time, ending a tense week on a slightly positive 
note.
Evergrande's stock rebound came after a plunge Thursday.
The developer said this week that it had called off a $2.6 billion deal that would have helped ease its 
punishing cash crunch.
The agreement, which would have seen Evergrande sell a controlling stake in its property management unit 
to rival Chinese developer, Hopson, was terminated as of Wednesday.
Both companies traded blame for the collapse of the deal, with Evergrande claiming in a stock exchange 
filing that ""the purchaser had not met the prerequisite to make a general offer for shares in Evergrande 
Property Services.""
Hopson said in a statement that it was ready to complete the deal, but ""other parties"" had attempted to 
change the terms of the agreement.
In recent weeks, Evergrande has been trying to resolve its cash flow issues by attempting to sell some 
of its assets, such as a partial stake in its electric vehicle business, as well as an office tower in 
Hong Kong.
But the company hasn't had much luck in its search for buyers, which is keeping investors on the edge.
At a financial forum in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He stressed that risks were

"Supply chain bottlenecks are weighing on economic growth in Europe. The same problem is hitting China 
as it battles an energy crunch and concerns about its huge real estate sector. And in the United 
States, factories can't produce as much as they'd like due to shortages of workers.
What's happening: Recent data makes clear that the world's major economic engines are losing 
steam, generating uncertainty about the strength of the coronavirus recovery.
The latest warning came Friday, when data provider IHS Markit released its Purchasing Managers' 
Index, a closely-watched gauge of economic health, for the 19 countries that use the euro.
The survey found that business activity in the region ""slowed sharply to a six-month low in October"" as 
snarled supply chains hit the manufacturing sector. Spending on services â€” a category that includes 
dining out, going to the movies and transportation â€” also took a hit due to ""ongoing Covid-19 concerns.""
""A manufacturing sector beset with supply chain delays saw production growth falter to the lowest 
[level] since the first lockdowns of last year,"" said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business 
economist. ""The services sector has meanwhile seen some of the summer rebound fade just as resurgent 
virus case numbers bring renewed concerns.""
Step back: For months, economists have argued that while supply chain problems are frustrating, they 
are outweighed by rocketing demand from shoppers who saved up during the pandemic. But the situation is 
starting to have a real impact on sentiment. IHS Markit found that in Europe, optimism in manufacturing 
hit its lowest level in a year due to concerns about securing parts.
The October PMI reading for the United States arrives later Friday.
There's more: The worrying data in Europe comes days after China â€” the only large economy to avoid 
recession in 2020 â€” said that its economic output is growing at the slowest pace in a year.
The country has been hit by shipping delays and mounting inventories, while an energy squeeze is denting 
factory production and leading to power cuts in some areas. Pressure is also building on China's 
heavily-indebted real estate sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of GDP.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said this week that US industrial production dropped 1.3% last month, as 
plants struggled with shortages of materials and qualified workers as well as the aftermath of Hurricane 
Ida.
Bringing it all together: It's hard to look at these developments without wondering whether economists 
are still too rosy about the state of the global economy. They remain cautious, but largely unfazed. 
In a recent update of its economic projections, the International Monetary Fund said it expects the 
world economy to grow 5.9% in 2021, just 0.1 percentage points lower than its July forecast. The 
outlook for 2022 remained unchanged.
""We've had a dramatic economic rebound, and that rebound is now transitioning to a recovery that's 
happening at a slower pace,"" Jeffrey Sacks, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East 
and Africa at Citi Private Bank, told me.
Big picture: The global economy, following a massive crash, looks incredibly strong by historical 
standards. But when prices start rising significantly at a moment of slowing economic growth, Wall 
Street and policymakers need to monitor the situation closely.
Shares of Snap (SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat, have seen some big swings since they started 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2017. But never like this.
The company's stock plummeted as much as 25% in after-hours trading on Thursday after it warned that 
recent changes to Apple's privacy policies were hurting its business, my CNN Business colleague Rishi 
Iyengar reports. Shares were last down 20% in premarket trading Friday.
Breaking it down: The company ""grappled with industry changes to the way advertising is targeted, 
optimized, and measured on iOS that created a more significant impact on our business than we had 
expected,"" Snap's chief business officer Jeremi Gorman said, referring to Apple's operating system.
Apple rolled out new privacy features as part of its iOS 14.5 update earlier this year, which gives 
iPhone users the ability to more easily opt out of letting apps track their behavior and sell their 
personal data to advertisers.
Snap had braced for the changes but was surprised by how big the impact was, according to CEO Evan 
Spiegel.
""While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple provided measurement solution 
did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and 
manage their ad campaigns for iOS,"" he told analysts.
The problem was made worse by supply chain issues and labor shortages. Companies don't want to buy ads 
if they can't meet the extra demand, Spiegel added.
Not alone: Facebook (FB) has been extremely vocal that it expects the iOS changes will damage its 
business, too. It launched a public relations bid opposing the overhaul late last year, claiming the 
move would be ""devastating"" to millions of small businesses that advertise on Facebook.
""We know businesses are experiencing challenges because of platform changes,"" Sheryl Sandberg, 
the company's chief operating officer, said in July.
Shares of Facebook, which reports results early next week, are down 3.6% in premarket trading Friday.
Former President Donald Trump is plotting a return to Wall Street.
Trump, whose companies have a long history of filing for bankruptcy, announced a deal this week to bring 
a new media company public by merging with a SPAC, or a special-purpose acquisition company, my CNN

The latest filings did not indicate how much revenue â€” if any â€” Trump Media & Technology Group generates. Yet it's likely to be minimal given that the firm's social media platform hasn't launched yet.

"When Amazon opened a sprawling warehouse in her community in March 2020, Jennifer Bates never guessed 
she'd find herself testifying before members of Congress one year later about the ""grueling"" conditions 
she experienced working inside it.
Bates, grandmother of seven, had been excited Amazon was coming to Bessemer, Alabama, because of the 
economic growth she thought it would bring to the area â€” and the possibility that a job there would 
allow her to spend more time with family.
What she found at Amazon instead was a job with 10-hour shifts that she felt were ""more strenuous"" than 
the 12-hour days she pulled at a previous company. The amount of walking required to get around a 
warehouse the size of 14 football fields, including going up and down flights of stairs, hurt her knees 
and caused her legs to swell, she said.
""Working 10 hours at the pace that they push you to go, the time off is either going to the doctor for 
something, soaking, resting, taking it easy on your days off,"" Bates, an Amazon associate, said in a CNN 
Business interview this month.
She considered quitting. But Bates determined there was a better response: fighting to improve it. ""Why 
couldn't I stand still and have an opportunity to fix something that was broken?""
That decision would ultimately thrust Bates into the national spotlight thanks to her role as part of 
a high-profile union push inside the Bessemer facility.
The workers and organizers behind the effort were fighting to create what would have been the first 
US-based union in Amazon's 27-year history. In the process, they rattled one of America's largest 
employers, which put on full display its aggressive tactics to combat unionization.
More than any other Amazon worker, it was Bates who became the face of this effort, potentially risking 
her livelihood in the process.
At the invitation of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Bates testified before the Senate Budget Committee on March 17. 
Speaking via Zoom, Bates appeared read damning prepared remarks.
""Amazon brags it pays workers above the minimum wage. What they don't tell you is what those jobs are 
really like,"" she said. ""From the onset, I learned that if I worked too slow or had too much time-off-task 
I could be disciplined or even fired."" Her testimony sparked a flurry of press coverage about 
Amazon's warehouse conditions, with Bates' name at the center.
In a statement at the time, an Amazon spokesperson pushed back on her characterizations: ""We take 
employee feedback seriously, including Ms. Bates', but we don't believe her comments represent the 
more than 90% of her fulfillment center colleagues who say they'd recommend Amazon as a great place 
to work to friends and family.""
The risks of speaking out so publicly were substantial. ""Anytime a worker gets involved in organizing 
with their coworkers, they're taking a risk and Jennifer Bates has been willing to take that risk on 
behalf of the people she works with,"" said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and 
employment relations at Rutgers University. ""She's been willing to talk to the media, to talk to 
Congress, to really fight very, very publicly.""
Bates knew this from the start. ""I had to be very careful [of] how I moved, how I spoke and what I did,"" 
she recalled. ""What good is it if I lose my job and the work that I started is not complete?""
The election to unionize, which took place by mail due to the pandemic over a nearly two-month period 
ending in April, resulted in workers largely voting against a union. But whether that vote will be 
upheld is still an open question.
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) appealed the election, 
alleging that Amazon â€” which vigorously fought the effort â€” wrongfully interfered. In August, a National 
Labor Relations Board official recommended the results of the election be scrapped and that a new 
election be held due to alleged illegal misconduct by Amazon. The NLRB has yet to make its determination 
on the matter and Amazon has indicated it may appeal the NLRB's findings.
For now the union effort continues at Bessemer â€” and so does Bates' sense that she might lose her job at 
the warehouse, where she still works, before that work is done.
For a decade before she joined Amazon, Bates worked in a unionized job at a US Pipe plant. She described 
her colleagues there as ""more like family"" and said workers ""didn't get any disrespect"" because they had 
the union.
That experience informed her action after she joined Amazon. It moved quickly: One day, she and a group 
of Amazon coworkers were secretly meeting with the RWDSU at the local Cracker Barrel about possibly 
organizing a union. Before long they had garnered enough interest from other Amazon employees to hold a 
union election at the facility, which would draw attention from prominent figures including President Joe 
Biden and Stacey Abrams.
Amazon had long faced criticism over workplace conditions inside its warehouses, including around the 
rates of serious injuries. But the scrutiny grew during the pandemic as households leaned even more on 
its delivery services. Workers, advocacy groups and politicians sounded the alarm on everything from the 
backbreaking pace of work to the lack of transparency around confirmed Covid-19 cases.
Several employees-turned-activists had pushed for Amazon to improve working conditions during the 
pandemic and later accused the company of retaliating against them â€” allegations that the company 
has denied. Just last month, Amazon settled with two corporate workers who claimed they were illegally 
fired. As part of the settlement, Amazon is required to post a notice to workers nationwide 
acknowledging that it cannot fire workers for organizing.
There were a host of issues Bessemer workers like Bates believed could be improved with the help of 
union representation, including adequate break time, better procedures for filing and receiving 
responses to grievances, higher wages and protection against Amazon allegedly wrongfully applying 
policies to discipline workers who express concerns. (Amazon has repeatedly said safety is a priority 
and it has a ""zero tolerance for retaliation against employees who raise concerns."")
To combat the union organizing, Amazon sent numerous text messages to workers, pulled them into 
one-on-one meetings on the warehouse floor and, in the kickoff to the election, required them to 
attend group meetings every few shifts. It launched an anti-union website that warned against paying 
dues, and posted signage in bathroom stalls.
In a statement to CNN Business earlier this year about the union effort, Amazon spokesperson Heather 
Knox said: ""We opened this site in March [2020] and since that time have created more than 5,000 
full-time jobs in Bessemer, with average pay of $15.30 per hour, including full healthcare, vision and 
dental insurance, 50% 401(K) match from the first day on the job; in safe, innovative, inclusive 
environments, with training, continuing education, and long-term career growth.""
Ahead of her decision to be more front-and-center with the union push, Bates' mother expressed some 
discomfort. ""She was the only one who felt kind of, you know, leery about me pushing,"" said Bates, who 
added that her mom came around. ""She knows that I have that fire.""
But Bates felt the impact of her Senate testimony almost immediately. The day after, a manager informed 
her that she was being stripped of her ambassadorship â€” a role she'd enjoyed that allowed her to help 
train new employees in the facility. (According to recommendations from the NLRB hearing officer, ""the 
evidence was insufficient to establish that Bates was denied ambassador work ... because of her Union 
sympathies."")
""Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union. They always have,"" Barbara Agrait, a 
spokesperson for Amazon, said in a statement in response to questions about Bates' experience, including 
why she lost her ambassadorship. ""As a company, we don't think unions are the best answer for our 
employees.""
She also felt a shift in how many colleagues viewed her: Some appeared ""frightened"" to talk to her; 
others said they had been informed by her speech. Even now, when she walks into the Amazon warehouse, 
there are times her badge temporarily doesn't scan and she thinks: ""Well, today's the day they got me.""
According to Givan, the risk associated with being a vocal workplace organizer, can also extend 
beyond one's current place of employment to other potential employers.
RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum called it ""a very, very scary thing"" to speak out as Bates has done. ""You're putting yourself out there to the whole world. You're facing all the wealth and power in the universe.""
Bates, he said, ""understood the civil rights dimension of what it was that was happening in Bessemer."" Roughly 85% of the workforce at the facility is Black and the majority are women, he said.
""For her, it is a calling,"" Appelbaum said.
Bates frequently talks about her decision to speak out, and even the results of the election, on spiritual 
terms: ""I believe in destiny. I believe that God [does] things in His own timing and if it's part of the 
journey, then I'm here for it.""
The outcome of that journey so far may not be quite what Bates had in mind, but Givan said the effort 
has successfully drawn mainstream attention to what workers are up against when organizing.
Bates, too, is hopeful about the broader effects her voice may have. ""I believe for so many years that 
companies have devalued employees into thinking that [they're] not valuable ... people have begun to 
stand up and say, you know what? They're nothing without us.""
""We're not pushovers. There needs to be a change in this country and we're not stopping until 
there's a change,"" she added. ""We're still moving. We're still on fire and we're not going to stop.""",Business
"President Joe Biden has for months been circumspect in describing the behind-the-scenes negotiations 
with Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema over his sweeping domestic ambitions. He emerged Thursday 
prepared to spill some of the details.
Speaking amid what all sides describe as final-stage talks on a major spending package containing 
much of Biden's social and environmental agenda, Biden said the two moderate senators were holdouts 
on critical priority items: expanding paid leave and Medicare, offering tuition-free community college 
and raising taxes on corporations.
If the President was frustrated at their recalcitrance over some of his most-promised items, he did 
not let it show. He praised Sinema as ""smart as the devil"" and said Manchin was ""not a bad guy.""
While the senators' positions have frustrated fellow Democrats, Biden adopted a pragmatic approach at 
a CNN Town Hall, saying he was searching for areas of compromise even as the two moderates wield 
outsized power on his presidency.
""When you're in the United States Senate, and you're President of the United States, and you have 50 
Democrats, every one is a President. Every single one -- so you gotta work things out,"" Biden said, 
acknowledging the limits of Democrats' power despite control over the White House and both chambers of 
Congress.
Until now, Biden had been careful to avoid laying out specifics on the plan as it was being haggled 
out among lawmakers and his legislative team. Even Thursday, Biden claimed he was unwilling to broker 
a plan remotely.
""We're down to four or five issues which I'm not going to negotiate on national television,"" he told 
Anderson Cooper.
Yet he proceeded to describe in detail how he'd arrived at critical compromises with Manchin and 
Sinema, and offered new insights on national television into two of the most important relationships 
in Washington.
He said a paid leave provision included in the original framework had been whittled down to four 
weeks, a significant concession from Biden's original goal of twelve weeks.
He said it would be a ""reach"" to include dental, vision and hearing coverage to Medicare, a key 
priority for progressives including independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, saying Manchin 
opposed it -- and that he believed Sinema was against it as well.
Instead, he said he was working to include an $800 voucher for dental coverage, and was still 
negotiating whether vision could be added, too.
He flatly said he was opposed to work requirements for a child tax credit, which Manchin has favored.
And he acknowledged that tuition-free community college was unlikely to make it in the final 
bill, saying instead an expansion of Pell grants could help drive toward expanded higher education.
""It's not going to get us the whole thing,"" he said, vowing to continue pressing his free college 
plan in the coming months.
Biden wasn't shy in describing the moderate Democrats' stances in detail. He acknowledged 
Sinema ""says she won't raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and on wealthy 
people,"" a major stumbling block in his pledge to fully pay for his package.
And he detailed Manchin's opposition to a major clean energy provision, saying he was worried 
about coal jobs in his state. He said he was working to convince Manchin to support the other programs.
""Joe is open to my convincing him that I can use it to increase environmental progress without it 
being that particular deal,"" he said, referencing the Clean Electricity Performance Program, or 
CEPP, which would give utilities federal grants to increase their share of electricity from clean 
sources and penalize those who fail to increase their clean electricity portfolios.
""Nothing has been formally agreed to,"" Biden said.",Politics
"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton urged the Supreme Court Thursday to allow Texas' controversial law 
that bars most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy to remain in effect while legal challenges play 
out.
He also asked the justices to deny a request from the Biden administration to leapfrog over a federal 
appeals court and agree to hear oral arguments this term and decide for itself whether the law passes 
constitutional muster. Paxton said, however, if the court does agree to add the case to its docket, the 
justices should use it as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision legalizing 
abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy.
""The heartbeat provisions in SB 8 reasonably further Texas's interest in protecting unborn life, which 
exists from the outset of pregnancy,"" Paxton wrote. He also said if the Supreme Court takes up the case 
it should overturn Roe and hold that SB 8 does not ""violate the Fourteenth Amendment.""
In December, the justices are already scheduled to hear a separate dispute concerning a Mississippi law 
that bars abortion after 15 weeks. In that case, the state is also asking the court to overturn Roe.
The dispute places the justices back in the center of a firestorm created by the Texas law that bars 
abortions before most women even know they are pregnant. Back in September, they agreed to allow the 
law to go into effect, but split bitterly in a 5-4 order. This time, however, they will review concrete 
evidence about the law's impact on the ground, which may sway some justices to change their votes. The 
court could issue an order as early as Thursday, but may wait for a reply from the government before 
acting.
Paxton's brief comes in response to a request from the Biden administration as well as abortion 
providers in the state to block a law that the government calls ""clearly unconstitutional.""
Acting Solicitor General Brian Fletcher told the justices in court papers filed earlier in the week that 
the law had ""nullified"" the court's abortion precedents within the state's borders. He said allowing it 
to remain in effect would ""perpetuate the ongoing irreparable injury to thousands of Texas women who 
are being denied their constitutional rights.""
As the justices consider the law again, they will review the record detailing how the law has impacted 
women and clinics on the ground over the past six weeks.
In sworn declarations, abortion providers say that it has had a chilling effect because staff are 
""plagued by fear and instability,"" and they ""remain seriously concerned that even providing abortions 
in compliance with S.B. 8 will draw lawsuits from anti-abortion vigilantes or others seeking financial 
gain"" under the law's enforcement provision, which offers up to $10,000 in damages.
Providers in neighboring states said under oath that they have been overwhelmed with patients traveling 
from Texas seeking an abortion. When Judge Robert Pitman of the US District Court for the Western 
District of Texas temporarily blocked the law earlier this month, he said that from the moment it went 
into effect, ""women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that 
are protected by the Constitution.""
And in a stark rebuke to the Supreme Court, Pitman wrote: ""That other courts may find a way to avoid 
this conclusion is theirs to decide; this Court will not sanction one more day of the offensive 
deprivation of such an important right.""
The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, however, has stayed Pitman's ruling, meaning the law is in effect 
for now. It rejected the Justice Department's petition to lift the stay last Thursday night. DOJ 
immediately told reporters it planned to appeal.
A key issue in the case is whether the federal government has the legal right or ""standing"" to bring the 
challenge at hand. The DOJ says it does, in part, because private individuals bringing suit are acting 
as agents of the state and the government has the power to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens.
Paxton, a Republican, says the federal government doesn't have the right to step in because of the 
unique way the law was written that bars Texas from enforcing it. Instead, private individuals are able 
to bring suit against anyone they think might be helping a woman get an abortion.
In Thursday's filing, Paxton says that the law does not violate the Constitution ""either as it was 
originally ratified or under current doctrine""
""The idea that the Constitution requires States to permit a woman to abort her unborn child is 
unsupported by an constitutional text, history or tradition,"" he said.
In Monday's briefs, the Justice Department called Texas' arguments ""breathtaking"" and ""dangerous.""
""If Texas is right, States are free to use similar schemes to nullify other precedents or suspend 
other constitutional rights,"" the DOJ said.
Although it is very rare for the Supreme Court to take up a case before the appeals process in the 
lower courts has played out, they may be interested in actually holding arguments and reading extensive 
briefs before weighing in on the law again. In September, they considered the law on the court's 
emergency docket -- often referred to as the ""shadow docket"" -- drawing criticism from those who felt 
like the justices acted on a significant issue without the benefit of full briefing on the matter.
On September 1, for example, when the court allowed the law to go forward, Justice Elena Kagan, joined 
by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, criticized the majority for acting ""hastily"" on an 
order ""of great consequence.""
""The majority's decision is emblematic of too much of this Court's shadow docket decisionmaking -- which 
every day becomes more unreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend,"" Kagan wrote.
Justice Samuel Alito later that month gave an unusual speech rejecting criticism that the court had 
improperly handled some of the cases on its emergency docket. He said the recent criticism by the media 
and political actors was geared to suggest ""that a dangerous cabal is deciding important issues in a 
novel, secretive, improper way, in the middle of the night, hidden from public view.""",Politics
"President Joe Biden said Thursday he would not support adding a work requirement for the enhanced 
child tax credit in the Democrats' massive social spending bill, putting him at odds with Democratic 
Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
Biden told Anderson Cooper at a CNN Town Hall: ""All these people are working anyway.""
Millions of children are set to be lifted out of poverty this year because the Democrats temporarily 
beefed up the child tax credit in the last coronavirus relief package.
Extending the enhanced credit is included in Democrats' massive social spending bill. But 
Manchin -- whose support is needed to pass the legislation -- has said he wants to once again require 
parents to work in order to qualify for the credit, a shift that could exclude millions of the nation's 
poorest families. Manchin has not provided details on what such a mandate would entail but pointed 
out to CNN's Dana Bash that ""there's no work requirement whatsoever.""
""Don't you think, if we're going to help the children, that the people should make some effort?"" he 
said in a September appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
The senator's office did not return a request for comment, but experts said the simplest way to mandate 
that households work to receive the benefit would be to bring back the credit's earnings requirement.
Until the pandemic relief measure was enacted, a family with less than $2,500 in earned income did not 
qualify for the child tax credit, and a single parent with two children earning between $2,500 and 
$30,000 received only a partial credit, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities. The credit was a maximum of $2,000 for each child up to age 17. 
That meant that more than 26 million children were unable to get the full credit because their 
parents' incomes were too low, according to Treasury Department estimates.
About half of Black and Latino children, as well as kids living in rural communities, received only a 
partial credit or no credit because of their families' low incomes, according to the Center on Budget 
and Policy Priorities.
Returning to those rules would mean many families would once again be ineligible for the payments, 
said Ashley Burnside, policy analyst with the left-leaning Center for Law and Social Policy. In 
particular, parents with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, people raising their 
grandchildren, gig workers, students with children and others could be left out.
The child tax credit is the centerpiece for President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats' efforts 
to reduce child poverty. They beefed up the credit to a maximum of $3,600 for each child up to age 6 
and $3,000 for each one ages 6 through 17 and ordered half of it to be paid in monthly installments this 
year. (Families can claim the other half when they file their 2021 taxes next year.)
Most importantly for poor families, lawmakers made the credit fully refundable so that more 
parents -- including those who don't work -- are eligible to receive it.
One benefit of the enhancement is that it has made it easier for the Internal Revenue Service to 
distribute the credit, said Sam Hammond, the director of poverty and welfare policy at the Niskanen 
Center who helped GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah craft a child allowance proposal.
""Any kind of earnings requirement -- even something relatively simple -- will dramatically undermine 
the administrative simplicity of the credit,"" he said, making it more difficult for the agency to 
determine who is eligible.
Early studies show that the initial monthly payments, which started in July, are already having an 
impact.
The first two child tax credit payments lifted 3.5 million kids out of poverty, according to a recent 
estimate by Columbia University's Center on Poverty & Social Policy. The child poverty rate was 11.5% in 
August, but it would have been 16.2% without the enhanced credits.
The payments also prompted a 25% decline in food insufficiency among low-income families with children, 
the center estimated.
But the enhancement is only in effect for 2021, and lawmakers are now seeking to extend it. The initial 
House bill called for continuing the larger monthly payments through 2025 and making the full 
refundability provision permanent.
The child tax credit, however, has become embroiled in the battle to reduce the size of the bill to 
gain the approval of Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, both moderate Democrats who have demanded 
the package be slashed.
Biden laid out a scaled-back proposal Wednesday that would extend the credit for only one or two years, 
sparking an uproar among more left-leaning Democrats.
Whether the fully refundable enhanced credit would be a disincentive for people to work remains a 
matter of debate among scholars.
A recent Columbia study that used data from two Census surveys found the initial payments did not have 
a negative impact on work.
""No matter what sample you're looking at, no matter what model you run, you don't find any meaningful 
effects on employment or labor force participation,"" said co-author Zachary Parolin, a senior research 
fellow at Columbia's Center on Poverty & Social Policy.
Likewise, a recent survey by the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute found that 90% of child 
tax credit recipients said the monthly payments have not affected their employment or that of anyone 
in their household. Some 5% said the funds are helping them work more, and 5% said the money is helping 
them work less.
But the possibility of long-term effects remains if the enhancement becomes permanent, said Angela 
Rachidi, a senior fellow at the institute.
Bruce Meyer, an economist with the University of Chicago, said it won't take long for the employment 
impact to be felt.
Some 1.5 million workers -- 2.6% of all working parents -- would exit the labor force within two years 
if the enhanced credit is extended, he said. Most of them would be at the lower end of the income scale.
Prior to the boost, the child tax credit rewarded work -- effectively giving a $2 increase after taxes 
to the wages of a single parent with two kids making $15 an hour, he said.
""Replacing it with a benefit that doesn't depend on whether or not you work reduces the incentive to 
work,"" said Meyer, who is also an American Enterprise Institute scholar.",Politics
"President Joe Biden said Thursday the US was committed to coming to Taiwan's defense if it comes 
under attack from China -- a stance that seems in opposition to America's stated policy 
of ""strategic ambiguity.""
Asked twice during CNN's town hall whether the US would protect Taiwan if China attacked, Biden said it 
would.
""Yes, we have a commitment to do that,"" he said.
Biden has made similar statements in the past, only to have the White House say longstanding US policy 
had not changed toward the island. The US provides Taiwan defensive weapons, but has remained 
intentionally ambiguous on whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack.
Under the ""One China"" Policy, the US acknowledges China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. 
In recent weeks, Beijing has sent dozens of warplanes near into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification 
Zone (ADIZ), and Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that ""reunification"" between China and Taiwan 
was inevitable.
A White House official attempted to clarify Biden's comments on Taiwan after the town hall, saying the 
President was ""not announcing any change in our policy and there is no change in our policy"" in his 
remarks about China and Taiwan.
""The U.S. defense relationship with Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act. We will uphold our 
commitment under the Act, we will continue to support Taiwan's self-defense, and we will continue to 
oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo,"" the official said.
Hours after the town hall, China's foreign ministry warned the United Stated not to send ""any wrong 
signals to the separatist forces of Taiwan independence"" Friday.
""China urges the US to strictly abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the China-US 
Three Joint CommuniquÃ©s, be cautious in its words and deeds on the Taiwan issue, and refrain from 
sending any wrong signals to the separatist forces of Taiwan independence, so as not to seriously 
damage China-US relations, peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,"" foreign ministry spokesman 
Wang Wenbin told a regular news briefing in Beijing Friday.
However, the Taiwanese were cheered by Biden's statement, thanking him for his words.
""Our government will continue to strengthen our self-defense capabilities to full defend Taiwan's 
democracy... national security and people's well-being,"" a statement from the foreign ministry said 
Friday.
Biden said Thursday he was not concerned about an intentional military conflict with China â€” but 
indicated he was worried about unintentional escalation.
""China, Russia and the rest of the world knows we have the most powerful military in history of the 
world. Don't worry about whether they're going to be more powerful,"" he said. ""But you do have to worry 
about whether or not they're going to engage in activities put them in a position where they may make a 
serious mistake.""
Biden, citing his relationship with Xi, said he wasn't looking to enter a prolonged conflict.
""I have spoken and spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other world leader has. That's why you hear 
people saying Biden wants to start a new cold war with China. I don't want a cold war with China. I want 
China to understand that we are not going to step back and change any of our views.""",Politics
"President Joe Biden admitted on Thursday that he was wrong to make a statement last week that those 
defying subpoenas from the House committee investigation the January 6 attack on the US Capitol should 
be prosecuted.
""No, the way I said it was not appropriate,"" Biden said. ""I should have chosen my words more wisely.""
He added, ""I did not, have not and will not pick up the phone and call the attorney general and tell 
him what he should or should not do in terms of who he should prosecute.""
Biden's statement comes as the House of Representatives voted on Thursday to hold former President 
Donald Trump's ally, Steve Bannon, in criminal contempt for defying the committee's subpoena.
Biden last week said those who refuse subpoenas from the House select committee investigating the 
January 6 riot at the US Capitol should be prosecuted by the Justice Department.
Asked by CNN's Kaitlan Collins at the White House what his message is to those who refuse subpoenas 
from the panel, Biden said, ""I hope that the committee goes after them and holds them accountable.""
Pressed on whether he thinks those people should be prosecuted by the department, the President 
said, ""I do, yes.""
The President's comments had been the strongest yet from him on possible repercussions for those who 
refuse to cooperate with the select committee's requests, upended days of discipline from the White 
House, which had sought to distance itself from the House's proceedings against Bannon.
Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley said following Biden's initial comments that ""the 
Department of Justice will make its own independent decisions in all prosecutions based solely on the 
facts and the law. Period. Full stop.""",Politics
"Neera Tanden was named White House staff secretary on a morning staff call on Friday, a person familiar 
with the matter and a senior White House official said, after her nomination to be President Joe 
Biden's budget chief was pulled earlier this year when key senators balked at some of her past tweets.
Since her nomination was pulled, Tanden has worked in the White House on communications efforts 
surrounding Biden's economic agenda.
The White House staff secretary is a behind-the-scenes but critical role in the West Wing, responsible 
for managing paper flow to the President from other areas of the administration and federal government. 
The person filling the job has been viewed as one of the most powerful in the building.
The Washington Post first reported the move.
Biden originally nominated Tanden to be director of the Office of Management and Budget. But Democratic 
Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia joined Republicans in blocking her confirmation, citing her past 
acerbic criticism of political adversaries in both parties.
Tanden withdrew from consideration in March. Shalanda Young, confirmed by the Senate as deputy budget 
director, is serving as acting director pending confirmation of a permanent choice.
Following Tanden's failed nomination, the White House had indicated that she would serve in another 
role within the administration. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in April that Biden 
remained ""interested in and committed to finding her a position in the administration and taking 
advantage of all her talents.""

Rep. Greg Pence -- the brother of former Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the electoral 
vote count on January 6 -- did not vote.
The action marks a significant escalation in how far Democrats are willing to go to rebuke individuals 
who refuse to cooperate as the House select committee investigates the violent attack that sought to 
overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
The vote by the full House to hold Bannon in criminal contempt of Congress sets up a referral to the 
Department of Justice, which would then have to decide whether to prosecute.
Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday said the Justice Department would review any referral, but 
at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, he did not say what the DOJ decision would be.
""The Department of Justice will do what it always does in such circumstances, we'll apply the facts and 
the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution,"" Garland said.
Earlier in the afternoon, the House voted to approve the rule providing for consideration of the 
contempt resolution. The rule passed on a largely party-line vote of 221 to 205, with only two 
Republicans joining Democrats to vote in favor.
""This isn't about punishing Steve Bannon,"" Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House 
committee, said Thursday. ""But Steve Bannon has led us down this path by refusing to cooperate in any 
way with our investigation.""
He added: ""We need to take a stand for the select committee's investigation and for the integrity of 
this body. What sort of precedent would it set for the House of Representatives if we allow a witness 
to ignore us flat out without facing any kind of consequences?""
Bannon has previously argued that he is unable to cooperate with the committee until matters of 
executive privilege are resolved by the courts.
His attorney has told the committee that ""the executive privileges belong to President Trump"" and ""we 
must accept his direction and honor his invocation of executive privilege.""
Following the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to certify the report to the United States 
attorney for the District of Columbia. Under law, this certification then requires the United States 
attorney to ""bring the matter before the grand jury for its action,"" but the Justice Department will 
also make its own determinations for prosecution.
Any individual who is found liable for contempt of Congress would be guilty of a crime that may result 
in a fine and between one and 12 months' imprisonment. But this process is rarely invoked and rarely 
leads to jail time.
Holding Bannon in criminal contempt through a prosecution could take years, and historically, criminal 
contempt cases have been derailed by appeals and acquittals.
As a result, the House's pursuit of criminal charges may be more about making an example out of Bannon 
and sending a message to other potential witnesses.
""I want our witnesses to understand something very plainly. If you are thinking of following the path 
Mr. Bannon has gone down you are on notice that this is what you'll face,"" Thompson said on Tuesday.
The vast majority of House Republicans opposed the effort to Bannon in contempt of Congress, brushing 
aside concerns about weakening the institution's future oversight authority and rejecting accusations 
that they're trying to block Democrats from getting to the bottom of the January 6 insurrection.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, when pressed by CNN on Thursday on whether he's okay with people 
defying congressional subpoenas, said the January 6 select committee's subpoena of Bannon is ""invalid.""
""He has the right to go to the court to see if he has executive privilege or not. I don't know if he 
does or not, but neither does the committee,"" McCarthy said. ""So they're weakening the power of Congress 
itself by issuing invalid subpoenas.""
Cheney, one of two Republicans on the special committee, criticized her colleagues Thursday for 
protecting Bannon.
""There are people in this chamber right now who were with me and with the rest of us on that day during 
that attack. People who now seem to have forgotten the danger of the moment, the assault on the 
Constitution, the assault on our Congress. People who you will hear argue that there is simply no 
legislative purpose for this committee for this investigation or for this subpoena,"" she said.
Cheney said the former President knew the riot was happening and took no action to stop it.
""President Trump knew it was happening. Indeed he may have been watching it all unfold on television. 
And yet he took no immediate action to stop it,"" she added.",Politics
"President Joe Biden said Thursday evening he's considering deploying the National Guard to help ease 
stress on the US supply chain as it prompts growing concern about the economy, prompting a White House 
official to swiftly throw cold water on the plan.
""Yes, absolutely, positively. I will do that,"" Biden said when asked by moderator Anderson Cooper 
during CNN's town hall in Baltimore if he was prepared to call up the National Guard. The President said 
he would specifically consider calling up National Guard members for trucking to help solve a shortage 
of drivers ""if we can't move -- increase the number of truckers, which we are in a process of doing.""
A White House official, however, told CNN shortly after that the administration is not actively 
considering deploying the National Guard despite Biden's comments. ""Requesting the use of the 
National Guard at the state level is under the purview of governors and we are not actively pursuing 
the use of the National Guard on a federal level,"" the official said.
Still, the President's comments underscore the severity of the supply chain crisis, which is denting 
Americans' views of the economy. Business groups have urged the Biden administration to consider 
out-of-the-box ideas to address the supply chain mess, which is snarling shipments, raising costs and 
leaving some store shelves empty. And economists say the supply chain problems are showing no signs of 
slowing and could last into next year.
While Biden has directed the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to move to 24/7 operations, the ports 
can't yet work round the clock because importers don't have enough drivers to move their cargo at all 
hours.
Asked on Tuesday whether the White House would consider bringing in the National Guard or Navy to help 
unload cargo stacked up at ports or drive trucks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, ""I'm not 
here to take options off the table.""
National Guard troops, a group composed of service members who hold civilian jobs and train part time, 
are usually deployed in their home states by governors or the federal government, who decide the length 
of each mission.
Asked Thursday if he had a timetable for potentially activating the National Guard, Biden said, 
""First of all, I want to get the ports up and running and get the railroads and the railheads and the 
trucks in port ready to move because I've gotten Walmart and others to say we're going to move stuff 
off of the port into our warehouses.""",Politics
"The Justice Department plans to call a US Secret Service official to testify at the first scheduled 
trial against a US Capitol riot defendant this fall, according to a new court filing.
The disclosure came in the case of Guy Reffitt, a father from Texas who is accused of obstructing 
Congress' certification of the 2020 election. He is scheduled to go to trial in mid-November in the 
first test before a jury among the more than 600 live Capitol riot cases.
Witness testimony from the Secret Service has the potential to be a major moment highlighting the peril 
for American elected officials during the insurrection -- including former Vice President Mike Pence.
Reffitt has pleaded not guilty to his five charges.
Prosecutors said in their court filing Thursday that the Secret Service official could testify about 
the ""Capitol breach's effect on the Secret Service's protection of Vice President Pence and his family 
members,"" a major security concern during the siege that Republicans have tried to downplay or outright 
deny, in the months following the riot.
Pence had been rushed off of the Senate floor and evacuated to a secure location as rioters stormed the 
US Capitol due to the threat of danger.
At one point, officials at the White House were made aware of a plan to evacuate Pence to Joint Base 
Andrews, which never ultimately transpired. Pence remained at the Capitol and later returned to the 
Senate chamber to oversee the Electoral College certification.
The Justice Department wants to limit the questions asked of the Secret Service official at the trial, 
arguing that some questions about the protective service could impact security provided to public 
officials.
More than 600 people from 44 states and Washington, DC, have been charged in federal court, according 
to CNN's latest tally, with authorities announcing new arrests on a near-daily basis.
So far, 19 Capitol rioters have been sentenced, mostly to federal misdemeanors. Eleven have received 
jail time.",Politics
"The prospects for reaching a tentative agreement on President Joe Biden's sweeping social safety net 
package by the end of the week are increasingly dire with Democrats still haggling over critical details 
of what to include and how to pay for the President's signature legislation.
The slow progress comes after Democratic senators said Tuesday they'd hoped to reach an agreement on a 
topline and overall framework by the weekend and as Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's has dug in on her 
opposition to raising the corporate tax rate and the top marginal rate on individuals has rocked the 
party's plans to finance the bill.
Sources familiar with the discussions say there are a host of thorny issues remaining including how to 
restructure prescription drug prices in a way that the US could negotiate directly with drug companies. 
There are also ongoing conversations about how to incentivize states to lower their carbon emissions and 
several issues to close out on who will qualify for programs like the expanded child tax credit and paid 
family leave. Overshadowing all of it is the fact that there still is no agreement on how much the bill 
should cost.
""There basically are three tough remaining issues: How do we raise revenue? Can we close the gap and 
deliver something meaningful on prescription drug pricing? And climate?"" one member said on the 
condition of background to summarize the outstanding issues.
Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia predicted Tuesday it was likely negotiations would stretch beyond this 
week.
""There are a lot of details,"" Manchin said.
Asked if it could be finished this week, Sinema said, ""Don't ask me, I can't answer that question.""
Part of the challenge for Democrats is even once a deal is clinched with key moderates, the rest of the 
Democratic caucus in the House and the Senate have to be read in, educated and agree to the provisions.
""It'll be very hard because one of the things before you adopt any framework, you accept it, certainly 
have to do a period of vetting so people have an understanding of it,"" House Ways and Means Chairman 
Richard Neal said.
Democrats have made significant progress this week with various subgroups of members working around the 
clock to clinch compromises on the outstanding issues. But, that progress can only happen so fast. 
Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Thursday that ""we are working very hard. Rolling 
up our sleeves. There are some outstanding issues, and we are working on them.""
Over the last week, the White House and Democratic leaders have zeroed in on trying to get Manchin to 
sign off on key pieces of the package, an attempt to put a bit more pressure on Sinema who aides and 
members say has been harder to pin down.
The uncertainty surrounding how to pay for the bill has also injected a new scramble into the debate 
with Neal and Finance Chairman Ron Wyden trying to find consensus for using other tax provisions other 
than raising the top marginal rate on individuals and raising the corporate tax rate.
A person familiar with Sinema's thinking told CNN on Thursday that the Arizona senator has worked with 
the White House on some alternatives to raise that money. However, there is no indication yet those 
ideas would have the support of others in the caucus. Neal met with Sinema for 40 minutes Thursday and 
cautioned that including new ideas to finance the bill could considerably slow the process down.
""I did point out. It's the ninth inning. I mean when are you going to vet these issues,"" Neal said, 
adding that while Sinema didn't signal she agreed, she did make it clear it was still her desire to 
see the bill pass.
The intense negotiations are just part of the reality of shrinking down a proposal that was once 
imagined to be at $3.5 trillion. Democrats are struggling to find a way cut back on key programs like 
Medicare expansion, the child tax credit extension and paid family leave even as many acknowledge that 
even a $1.5 trillion bill will be a huge investment in the country's social infrastructure.
""It is hard to keep 50 people together with different constituencies. I am not whining,"" Sen. Sherrod 
Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said.",Politics

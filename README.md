# Naive Bayes Text Classifier
This is my first ever attempt at a text classification program that I wrote during my undergraduate using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm.
It consists of a Jupyter notebook outlining a class that implements the algorithm, and 3 folders containing news articles of 3 different categories; sports, business and politics. The articles are organized according to the category they were given by cnn.com. The model is compared to SciKit-Learn's Naive Bayes classification model, and will run regardless of how
many articles are included in the data directories. Currently, the program does not use a large amount of training data, which may produce inconsistent results in both 
Scikit-Learn's model and my custom model.

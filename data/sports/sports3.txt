Greece's Maria Sakkari will make her debut at the WTA Finals after the 26-year-old qualified for 
the season-ending championships after reaching the quarterfinals at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow.
Sakkari edged past Russia's Anna Kalinskaya in the second round on Thursday, taking the first set 
6-2 before Kalinskaya retired in the second set which Sakkari was leading 1-0.
Sakkari, who will face Simona Halep in the last eight, continues a breakthrough season where she 
finished runner-up at the WTA 500 event in Ostrava, Czech Republic and reached the semifinals at the 
French and the US Open majors.
"I'm very proud of myself and my team that we actually made it to the Finals for the first time, and 
for the first time in the history of Greece for a female tennis player," Sakkari said.
"I was very hard on myself up until this year ... Growing, and also getting older and more mature, 
you see certain things different.
"Being nice to myself was one of the most important things I've changed this year, being nice during 
the games and the matches."
The world number seven is the fifth player after Ash Barty, Aryna Sabalenka, Barbora Krejcikova and 
Karolina Pliskova to qualify for the Finals, which will be held in November in Guadalajara, Mexico.
The Finals, contested by the world's top eight singles players and eight doubles teams, was moved 
out of China's Shenzhen after last year's event was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
